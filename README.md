# Algorithm-to-assess-unmeasured-symptom-severity--in-gynecologic-care
This repository includes all the code that created composite symptom severity indices to capture relevant markers that influence the decision for hysterectomy in the 2022 AJOG paper, "Development of an algorithm to assess unmeasured symptom severity in gynecologic care".

There are 9 separate files in this analysis: 3 files to create the new measures, 3 files that compare each new measures with an objective measure, and single files that create tables and figures published.                      

Job 00 (SAS) creates the bulk symptom severity measure and a summary of the measure

Job 01 (SAS) creates the bleeding symptom severity measure and a summary of the measure

Job 02 (SAS) creates the pain symptom severity measure and a summary of the measure

Job 03 (SAS) descriptive characteristics of individuals in study population (Table 1)

Job 04a (SAS) compares weighted index for bleeding severity with symptom-specific diagnostic codes

Job 04b (SAS) compares weighted index for bulk severity with symptom-specific diagnostic codes

Job 04c (SAS) compares weighted index for pain severity with symptom-specific diagnostic codes

Job 05 (R) shows the distribution of bulk, bleeding, and pain composite symptom severity indices (Figure 2)

Job 06 (SAS) shows the distributions of symptom presence/absence by symptom severity score (Supplemental Digital Content 3-5)
